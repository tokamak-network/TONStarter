# Pools

{% hint style="info" %}
Pools in Tokamak Bridge are serviced using Uniswap v3 contracts.

* If your network is set to Ethereum, Tokamak Bridge will use the official Uniswap v3 contracts.
* If your network is set to Titan, Tokamak Bridge will use Uniswap v3 contracts deployed by Tokamak Network.

For developers, we recommend referring to Uniswap v3's [development guide](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Titan Network will undergo maintenance at the following times:

* Titan: Every Friday from 9:00 to 10:00 (GMT+9)

When the network goes live again, **Liquidity position may experience sudden price movements** if L1 market prices shifted while the Titan Network was down. Please consider the risk of network downtime when deciding to provide liquidity on Titan Network.
