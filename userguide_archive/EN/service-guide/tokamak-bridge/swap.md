# Swap

{% hint style="danger" %}
On Ethereum network, TON cannot be directly swapped to other tokens using Tokamak Bridge. Please wrap it to WTON first and then swap using WTON. We will support direct swap for TON in the future.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Swap and Pools in Tokamak bridge is a service that utilizes Uniswap v3 contracts. If your network is set to Ethereum network, it will use Uniswap v3 contracts deployed by Uniswap. If it is set to Titan network, it will use Uniswap v3 contracts deployed by Tokamak Network.
{% endhint %}
