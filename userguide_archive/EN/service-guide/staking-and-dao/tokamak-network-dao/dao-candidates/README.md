### 3. DAO committee member

The three people with the highest staking amount can become DAO committee members.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The total staking amount includes both the amount staked by the candidate and the amount staked by others on behalf of the candidate.
{% endhint %}

* Click the "Challenge" button (marked as number 1 in the image below), then confirm in the Metamask pop-up window. Choose an existing DAO member with less staked TON than you do.
