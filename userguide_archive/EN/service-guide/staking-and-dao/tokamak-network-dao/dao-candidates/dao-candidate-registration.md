# DAO candidate registration

To join the DAO committee, you must create and register as a DAO candidate. This document provides instructions on how to create and register as a candidate if you aspire to serve on the DAO committee.

### 1. Create DAO candidate

* To create a DAO candidate, navigate to the [CommitteeProxy page](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd9f0ccc044b0781289ee318e5971b0139602c26#writeProxyContract#F5).
* Click the Connect to Web3 button to link with your account.

* Input the DAO candidate's name into the _\_memo_ field of the _createCandidate function_. Next, click on the Write button. This is the name it will show on simple staking and Tokamak Network DAO page.&#x20;

### 2. Register DAO candidate

* Verify if the DAO candidate, created as mentioned above, is listed on the simple staking page.
* Stake more than 1,000.1 TON to the created DAO candidate. The staked 1,000 TON serves as collateral and is non-withdrawable.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the account that created the DAO candidate can stake 1,000.1 TON as collateral for that DAO candidate.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Once the staking is completed, if you navigate to the DAO page, you should see yourself listed as a DAO candidate.
