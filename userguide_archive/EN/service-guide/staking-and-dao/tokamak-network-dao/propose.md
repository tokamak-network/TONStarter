# Propose

Agenda items can be categorized into two types:

* Type A: Proposals pertaining to economic factors (e.g., staking, inflation, assets in DAO, etc).
* Type B: Proposals concerning technical factors (e.g., contract upgrade, authority adjustment, etc).

Each type further divides into sub-categories, following a progression from Step 1 through to Step 3, as illustrated below. Clicking on the final 3rd stage sub-type will trigger a corresponding proposal form.

### 1. Type A

This allows you to make proposals related to economic factors (e.g., staking, inflation, assets in DAO, etc).
