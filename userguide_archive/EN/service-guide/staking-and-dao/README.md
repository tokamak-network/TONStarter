# Staking & DAO

Simple staking and Tokamak Network DAO are connected.

1. Users can stake TON or WTON to DAO candidates and receive staking rewards accordingly.
2. If a DAO candidate's total staked amount is in the top 3 among all candidates, they can become one of the three members who make decisions in the DAO committee.
