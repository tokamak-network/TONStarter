### 1. Features

Tokamak Networkâ€™s staking is used to select the DAO committee members that can vote on agendas. Here's how it works:

* Users can stake their TON or WTON on DAO candidates to earn staking rewards and support the DAO candidate to become one of the DAO committee members.
* The three DAO candidates with the highest staking can become DAO committee members, where they can vote on DAO agendas.
