### **3. Stake**

There is a simulator in the upper right corner of the staking screen. With this, you can calculate the expected return rate according to the amount and duration of staking.

* Select the duration of the stake.&#x20;

* The expected amount of TON (or WTON) to be acquired during the selected period is displayed here.&#x20;
* USD value, APY, and KRW value of the TON amount to be obtained are displayed here.&#x20;
* When you click the Stake button, a popup window where you can stake appears.&#x20;
* To recalculate, click the Recalculate button.&#x20;
* When you click the Stake button, a popup window as below appears, and the quantity entered in the simulator is displayed identically, so you can conveniently execute staking immediately (quantity modification is also possible). You can stake TON or WTON.
