Tokamak Network's primary achievement in Ethereum layer 2 solutions is the introduction of Titan, an optimistic rollup solution. Tokamak Network's vision extends far beyond a single solution, and its overarching vision is to create a versatile ecosystem that supports multiple types of layer 2 solutions. This approach empowers dapp developers and operators to choose and operate layer 2 solutions that best suite the unique characteristics of their applications.

Titan offers users the advantage of faster transaction processing and decreased transaction fees. dapp developers can conveniently build smart contracts on Titan using the same development experience they are accustomed to with Ethereum.
