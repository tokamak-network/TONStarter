# Bond

### 01. Introduction

You can purchase TOS at a discounted price using bonding.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
* However, there is a minimum lock-up period of 5 days, which means that you can use TOS afterward.&#x20;
* The discount is given to compensate for the wait.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Any TOS purchased using bonds are automatically staked as LTOS to ensure that the bond value is not depreciated

{% hint style="info" %}
if the lock-up period is at least 1 week, you will receive sTOS, the governance token for TONStarter as well.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In the Bond page, you can see 3 items as below.

* ⓵ **Treasury Balance** : This shows the total value of the current non-TOS assets held by the Treasury. All circulating TOS is backed by the treasury balance.  &#x20;
* ⓶ **TOS Price**: This shows the current market price of TOS. &#x20;
* ⓷ **Bond List** : This shows the list of bond markets. You many not be able to bond if the discount is negative or if the capacity is 0.&#x20;
