  TOS can be staked for LTOS or locked for a specific lock-up period for LTOS
  and sTOS. LTOS is an indexed token that can be swapped for TOS, and the swap
  ratio is determined using LTOS index.

# Stake

### 01. Introduction

Click on Stake button

* ⓵ Total Value Staked: represents the total dollar value of all LTOS in circulation.&#x20;
* ⓶ TOS APY: represents the expected annual percentage yied based on the rebase rate that increases the LTOS index every 8 hours.&#x20;
* ⓷ LTOS Index: represents the swap ratio between TOS and LTOS. If you stake TOS, you earn LTOS based on the LTOS index. The LTOS index is increased every 8 hours to give interest to LTOS holders.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
How LTOS index works?

* For example, suppose LTOS index is 2.0 TOS
* Then, if you stake 100 TOS, you will get 100/2 = 50 LTOS.&#x20;
* Suppose that LTOS index is increased to 3.0
* Then you can unstake your 50 LTOS for 3\*50 = 150 TOS, which means you have earned 50 TOS from staking your TOS.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* ⓸ Stake: you can use this to stake or lock your TOS for LTOS and sTOS. sTOS can be earned if you set a lock-up period.&#x20;
* ⓹ List selection: you can filter your results by bond or stake or all.&#x20;
* ⓺ Manage: you can use this to increase sTOS if lock-up period is not finished yet.&#x20;
* ⓻ Rebase time: this shows the next time the LTOS index is expected to be updated. LTOS index is updated every 8 hours, and it will update at 4:00, 12:00, 20:00 (UTC+9) everyday.

* In the example below, 30 TOS was additionally locked and the lock-up period is changed from 4 to 20 weeks. The current lock-up period is represented in green and the increased lock-up period is represented in blue in the slider UI.

### 04. How to relock

As soon as the lock-up period is finished, you can relock your LTOS for a new lock-up period to earn more sTOS.&#x20;

* After the lock-up period is finished, "Manage" will turn into "Relock"
* Click 'Relock' to increase the sTOS amount

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (224).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Input the LTOS amount that you would like to relock. If you choose to relock less than, the difference will be paid back in TOS.&#x20;
* Decide the new lock-up period for your relocking.
* Click 'Approve' to execute your relock.
* Input the LTOS amount that you would like to relock. If you choose to relock less than, the difference will be paid back in TOS.
