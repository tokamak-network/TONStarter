# TONStarter

TONStarter is a decentralized launchpad platform for Layer 2 projects. Through the Launch menu, anyone can create project tokens and build a token ecosystem within TONStarter. After project deployment, TONStarter's Starter menu allows for funding, and the My Project menu enables operational management after funding completion.

This guide consists of two parts.

First, the Launch section explains how to launch a blockchain project from the perspective of the Project team.

Second, the Participate section explains how to participate as an investor in a launched project.
