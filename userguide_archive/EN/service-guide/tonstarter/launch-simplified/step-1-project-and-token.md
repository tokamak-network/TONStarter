<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (192).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Create Project Form</p></figcaption></figure>

**01. Basic Information Input (Name, Symbol, etc.)**

1. **Project Name**: Enter the name of the project you want to launch (character limit: 20).
2. **Token Name**: Enter the name of the token to be used in the project.
3. **Token Symbol**: Token Symbol is the abbreviated name used to represent the project token. For example, Ether is represented as ETH, and Bitcoin is represented as BTC. When the token is listed on DEX, the Token Name and Token Symbol are displayed together and used for trading.
4. **Token Symbol Image**: Enter the URL address where the image of the token is posted.
5. **Description**: Enter information about the project's background, features, and step-by-step goals. Organize and include relevant information about the project so that investors in the community can clearly understand the nature of the project and decide whether to participate.

Once the input is complete, click the Save & Continue button to proceed to step 2.

**02. Schedule Input (Schedule)**

1. Snapshot

* The amount of project tokens that investors can purchase during the whitelist period varies depending on their sTOS holdings.&#x20;
* The reference point that determines these sTOS holdings is called Snapshot. The default value sets the Snapshot time as 11 days after the current time. You can move the Snapshot time forward to 8 days if you wish.

2. Whitelists

* It refers to the period during which only those who hold sTOS can purchase project tokens.&#x20;
* The allocation of project tokens for each tier based on sTOS holdings is set as follows by default, so you do not need to enter separate information (if you want to directly modify these allocation ratios, you can go to advance mode to set them).

| Tier    | sTOS holdings  | Project toke allocation |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Tier 1  |  600 sTOS \~   | 6%                      |
| Tier 2  |  1,200 sTOS \~ | 12%                     |
| Tier 3  | 2,200 sTOS \~  | 27%                     |
| Tier 4  | 6,000 sTOS \~  | 55%                     |

{% hint style="info" %}
Whitelist period is **automatically determined** as follows (period modification is only available in advance mode).

* Whitelist period: From immediately after the snapshot to just before Public Sale 1.
* This period can be shortened, but at least a period of two days must be secured.
* Therefore, the starting point of Public Sale 1 will be at least two days after the snapshot.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

3. Public sale 1&#x20;

* This is a period where anyone can invest regardless of the amount of sTOS they hold.&#x20;
* Period: 2 days after the end of the whitelist period (starting point only can be modified).
* Detailed modifications to the starting point, period, and end point can only be made in advance mode.

3. Public sale 2

* This is a period where anyone can invest regardless of the amount of sTOS they hold.&#x20;
* Period: 5 days after the end of Public sale 1 (starting point only can be modified). Detailed modifications to the starting point, period, and end point can only be made in advance mode.

**03. Project Description**

1. Provide a detailed description of the project to help investors understand it.&#x20;

* You can freely include the background, vision & mission, step-by-step implementation strategy, expected results, etc.

2. If you want to provide more detailed information, please use advance mode.&#x20;
