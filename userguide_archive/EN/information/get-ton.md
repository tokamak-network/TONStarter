# Get TON

### 1. CEX

{% hint style="info" %}
TON is listed on several CEX. While the ticker name may vary from one CEX to another, they all represent the same [token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2be5e8c109e2197D077D13A82dAead6a9b3433C5).\
Listed as **TON**: [Upbit](https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.KRW-TON),  [Upbit (Indonesia)](https://id.upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.IDR-TON)\
Listed as **TOKAMAK**: [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/trade/TOKAMAK\_USDT?type=spot), [Coinone](https://coinone.co.kr/exchange/trade/tokamak/krw)
{% endhint %}

### 2. DEX

Instead of using CEX, you can directly swap your tokens for TON from decentralized exchanges (DEX).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even though TON is an ERC20 token, it cannot be swapped directly using Uniswap (and other DEX) due to a security feature. Currently, only Tokamak Network Swap supports direct swaps between TON and other tokens.

To use DEX other than Tokamak Network Swap, you have to wrap TON to WTON first using Tokamak Network Swap or Tokamak Bridge and then swap.
