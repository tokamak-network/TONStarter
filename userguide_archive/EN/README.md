# What is Tokamak Network?

1. **Easy Layer 2 Network Deployment:** With Tokamak Network, you can build customizable Layer 2 networks. This ease of development promotes growth.
2. **Layer 2 Interoperability:** Your custom Layer 2 network can connect to any other Layer 2 within Tokamak Network. The Cross-Layer Message Protocol enables network communication without needing to go through the base layer.
3. **Improved Security:** Staking TON enhances your Layer 2 network's security. Tokamak Network ensures every Layer 2 network is fully verified from the start.
4. **Decentralized Governance:** TON stakers govern Tokamak Network. This decentralized governance enables network upgrades, ecosystem expansion, and protocol improvements to be coordinated and implemented autonomously.
