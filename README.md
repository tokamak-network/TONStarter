## What is TONStarter?
[TONStarter](https://tonstarter.tokamak.network) is a decentralized launchpad platform, designed to support projects on the Ethereum Network and layer 2, based on the OP stack. 

----

The [Optimism Collective](https://app.optimism.io/announcement) builds open-source software for running L2 blockchains and aims to address key governance and economic challenges in the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. Optimism operates on the principle of **impact=profit**, the idea that individuals who positively impact the Collective should be proportionally rewarded with profit. **Change the incentives and you change the world.**

In this repository, you'll find numerous core components of the OP Stack, the decentralized software stack maintained by the Optimism Collective that powers Optimism and forms the backbone of blockchains like [OP Mainnet](https://explorer.optimism.io/) and [Base](https://base.org). Designed to be "aggressively open source," the OP Stack encourages you to explore, modify, extend, and test the code as needed. Although not all elements of the OP Stack are contained here, many of its essential components can be found within this repository. By collaborating on free, open software and shared standards, the Optimism Collective aims to prevent siloed software development and rapidly accelerate the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. Come contribute, build the future, and redefine power, together.

## Documentation

- If you want to build on top of OP Mainnet, refer to the [Optimism Documentation](https://docs.optimism.io)
- If you want to build your own OP Stack based blockchain, refer to the [OP Stack Guide](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started), and make sure to understand this repository's [Development and Release Process](#development-and-release-process)

## Specification
If you're interested in the technical details of how Optimism works, refer to the [Optimism Protocol Specification](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs).
