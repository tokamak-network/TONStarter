## Local hosting
You can host TONStarter in local environment. Please follow this guide. As this is more of a reference hosting, we do not recommend using this software for production. Please do your own research.
- [TONStarter](https://github.com/tokamak-network/tonstarter-frontend/tree/archiving)
- [TOSv2](https://github.com/tokamak-network/tosv2-interface/tree/archiving)

Please note that interacting with newly created UniswapV3 rewards programs requires building an event-driven database (such as a subgraph). After that, you can use our Etherscan guide or local hosting guide to connect to it.

## Contributing
